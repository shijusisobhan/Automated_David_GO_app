# Automated DAVID GO Enrichment App
This project provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Web App for automating Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the DAVID web service and MyGene.info API.

 Web App (Streamlit): [Launch it here](https://automateddavidgoapp-jmttt2v2fbex2x7tcjhnvg.streamlit.app/)

 Desktop App (Tkinter): Cross-platform Python GUI â€” no coding required

## Features
 -Upload any .csv file with gene lists (multiple columns allowed)

 -Accepts official gene symbols, ENSEMBL IDs, or Entrez IDs

 -Automatically detects gene ID type and converts to ENSEMBL for DAVID

 -Select species from supported options: human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruitfly

 -Connects directly to DAVID Web Services (requires registered email)

 -Retrieves GO results (BP, CC, MF, KEGG)

 -Outputs GO enrichment results as .csv file to your system

-Desktop version saves results in same folder as input CSV

 -Works offline (except for querying DAVID/MyGene APIs)

## Requirements
1. DAVID Email Registration
You must have a registered email on the DAVID Web Service.

Register here: [DAVID Webservice Registration](https://davidbioinformatics.nih.gov/webservice/register.htm)

2.  Gene List File (see the example file)
File format: .csv

Each column should contain a gene list (symbols, ENSEMBL IDs, or Entrez IDs)

Column names will be selectable in the app

## Advantages Over Existing Tools
-No manual formatting or ID conversion needed

-Supports mixed gene ID types

-Multi-platform (web or desktop)

-No command line or scripting knowledge required

-Fast and reproducible enrichment workflow

## Installation (for Desktop App)
1. Clone this repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-david-go.git
   cd automated-david-go
   ```

3. Create environment & install dependencies
```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

you need Python 3.8+ installed.

3. Run the App
```
bash
python Automated_DAVID_GO_Desktop.py

## Launch Web App (Streamlit)
Click below to launch the web version (no install needed):
[Launch Web App](https://automateddavidgoapp-jmttt2v2fbex2x7tcjhnvg.streamlit.app/)


## Output
Results saved as: GO_<selected_column>.csv

ENSEMBL ID list saved as: submitted_genes.txt

Both saved to the same folder as the input .csv.
